# Journey to Growth

## Learning journey to web developer status

## Plans/Designs

I'll be documenting potential designs and ideas here in list form as my skills progress. Github's version control allows me to look back at he changes through comments and pushes, however, I'd like to centralize it in a *journal* like form here in the READme document.

* Header background manipulation
* Buttons for navigation
* Buttons for footer social media links

## Issues

    Nothing to report at this moment.
